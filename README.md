# Description 

Make sure you have Ruby version 2.5.0 or higher installed, then you are ready to go!
You will need the following commands:
- `bundle install` to install all the gems
- `bundle exec jekyll serve` to run the tests (add `--livereload` for auto reloading after file changes)
- `bundle exec jekyll build` to build the site

That's it, it is that simple!
